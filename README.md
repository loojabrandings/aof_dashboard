### Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash

   ```

2. **Set Up Supabase Database**
   
   a. **Create Supabase Project** (if not already done):
      - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
      - Wait for the project to be ready (takes 1-2 minutes)
   
   b. **Run Database Schema**:
      - Open your Supabase project dashboard
      - Go to **SQL Editor**
      - Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
      - Click **Run** to create all tables
   
   c. **Get Your Credentials**:
      - Go to **Settings** → **API**
      - Copy your **Project URL** and **anon/public key**

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```
   
   Or copy from `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Then edit `.env` with your actual Supabase credentials.

   ```

## Data Storage

### Cloud Storage (Supabase)
- **Primary Storage**: All data is stored in Supabase cloud database
- **Accessible Everywhere**: 
  - ✅ Any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
  - ✅ Any device (PC, tablet, phone)
  - ✅ Incognito/Private mode (with internet connection)
  - ✅ Automatic sync across all devices
- **No Manual Backup Needed**: Data is automatically saved to the cloud

### Backup/Export (Optional)
- **Export**: Go to Settings → Data Management → Export to File
  - Saves all data as a JSON file on your PC
  - File name: `aof-ms-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
  - Useful for offline backup or migration
  
- **Import**: Go to Settings → Data Management → Import from File
  - Select a previously exported JSON file
  - All data will be imported to Supabase
  - Page will reload after import

## Database Schema

The database includes the following tables:
- `orders` - Customer orders
- `inventory` - Stock items
- `expenses` - Business expenses
- `products` - Product catalog (stored as JSON)
- `settings` - Application settings (stored as JSON)
- `tracking_numbers` - Tracking number management
- `order_counter` - Sequential order numbering

All tables are created automatically when you run `supabase-schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor.

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing Supabase environment variables" Error
- Make sure you have a `.env` file in the root directory
- Check that `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set correctly
- Restart the dev server after creating/updating `.env`

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify your Supabase project is active (not paused)
- Check that you ran the SQL schema in Supabase SQL Editor
- Ensure your API keys are correct in `.env`

### Data Not Saving
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies are set (included in schema)
- Make sure you're using the correct project URL and API key
